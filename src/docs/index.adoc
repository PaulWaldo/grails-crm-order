== Order Management Plugin

This plugin provide storage and services for managing orders in {gr8crm} applications.

Note that this plugin does not contain any user interface components. This plugin contains domain classes and services only.
The plugin http://gr8crm.github.io/plugins/crm-order-ui/[crm-order-ui] provides a Twitter Bootstrap based user interface for managing orders.
+crm-order-ui+ depends on +crm-order+ so you only need to include +crm-order-ui+
in your BuildConfig.groovy if you want end-user order management features.
